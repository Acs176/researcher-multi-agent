Cite original papers/sites.", "answer": "Here are three reputable benchmarks used to evaluate LLM factuality, with a short description of what each measures and a citation to the original paper/site.\n\n1) FEVER \u2014 Fact Extraction and VERification  \n- What it measures: claim verification against a large textual knowledge source (Wikipedia). Given a claim, systems must (a) retrieve evidence sentences and (b) classify the claim as SUPPORTED, REFUTED, or NOT ENOUGH INFO. Useful for evaluating fact-checking/evidence-grounded generation.  \n- Reference: Thorne et al., FEVER (2018). https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05355\n\n2) TruthfulQA \u2014 Measuring How Models Mimic Human Falsehoods  \n- What it measures: tendency of models to produce false but human-like answers to open-ended questions. The benchmark contains diverse adversarial/knowledge questions where humans commonly produce falsehoods; evaluation focuses on whether model outputs are truthful (human-judged), not merely n-gram overlap. Good for assessing hallucination and deceptive-but-plausible responses.  \n- Reference: Lin et al., TruthfulQA (2021/ACL 2022). https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07958  (ACL version: https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.229/)\n\n3) QAGS \u2014 QA-based metric for factual consistency (summarization)  \n- What it measures: factual consistency of generated summaries (or other outputs) by (1) generating question\u2013answer pairs from the generated text, (2) answering those questions from the source document, and (3) measuring agreement between answers (e.g., F1). It provides an automatic, targeted way to detect content hallucinations/contradictions relative to a source.  \n- Reference: Wang et al., \u201cAsking and Answering Questions to Evaluate the Factual Consistency of Summaries\u201d (ACL 2020). https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.450/\n\nIf you want, I can (a) add one or two more benchmarks (e.g., FactCC, FEVEROUS), (b) summarize key metrics and typical model baselines on each, or (c) point to dataset download/leaderboard pages.
